# Notes

### My notes will be over the hardware section of this game, including a description of each component's functions, a picture of each component, a short explanation of how each component is constructed, and additional resources as I deem important. 
*Thank you to users lakshmiprabha and pratikshekhar99 from geeksforgeeks.org, as well as Olav Junker Kjær for the resources used in these notes.*
